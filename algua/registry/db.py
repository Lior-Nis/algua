# Any column/constraint change to an existing table needs a real migration
# (write it explicitly when the need arrives) — not just a bump of this number.

-- foreign key into strategies(id). These are operational/audit snapshots, not
-- relational children of the registry. audit_log in particular is an immutable
-- trail that MUST survive a strategy's removal, and there is intentionally no
-- strategy-deletion path in the codebase. Keying by name (rather than id +
-- ON DELETE CASCADE) keeps these records readable and self-contained even after
-- the parent strategy is gone. The normalized core (stage_transitions,
-- approvals) keeps its integer FK to strategies(id) precisely because it is
-- relational state that should not outlive its strategy.
