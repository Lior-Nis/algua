    """The stable exception-type -> machine code registry (the documented source of truth for
    ``docs/contracts/cli-error-envelope.md``).

    Built lazily inside this function (only ever called while rendering an error) so the CLI happy
    path never imports the domain-exception modules for their own sake: any exception that reaches
    here has, by construction, already had its defining module imported (that is where it was
    raised), so every import below is a cached ``sys.modules`` hit — zero extra load cost and no
    import-cycle risk. Keyed by exception *type* (identity), not class name, so an unrelated future
    class that merely shares a name can never mis-map.

    Order matters: subclasses precede their bases so :func:`error_code`'s first-match walk returns
    the most specific code, falling through to the generic ``ValueError``/``LookupError`` buckets
    last. Every failure still resolves — anything unmatched is ``internal`` (see the resolver).
